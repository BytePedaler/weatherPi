BytePedaler's WeatherPi

Thanks for stopping by! In July 2024 I started this dream project of mine 
with some very rough python script. While the code is undoubtedly still 
rough, the progress has been steady and I've been learning a ton in the 
process! The goal of this project is to gather hyperlocal weather data. 
Currently, the focus is primarily on weather trends in the downtown 
Portland, Oregon area.

Current terminal initialization procedure:
1. cd weatherpi/
2. cd weatherPi/
3. ls
4. python3 main.py

Upcoming updates:
1. Fix for gas sensor (currently not outputting correctly).
2. Cleaner data presentation in CSV.
3. Fix for timing delay causing missed reading every 15th recording.
4. Improved data recording accuracy.
