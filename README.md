BytePedaler's WeatherPi

Thanks for stopping by! This is an ongoing project of mine to gather hyperlocal weather data.
As of July 2024, I have 1 sensor collecting data in downtown Portland, Oregon.

Current terminal initialization procedure:
1. cd weatherpi/
2. cd weatherPi/
3. ls
4. python3 main.py

Upcoming updates:
1. Fix for particulate sensor readings
2. Fix for gas sensor (currently not reading at all)
3. Cleaner data presentation in CSV
